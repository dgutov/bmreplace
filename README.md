This is a Mozilla Firefox extension that allows you to quickly replace an
existing bookmark with a bookmark of current page.

Can be useful for reading and tracking progress in:

* Series of articles
* Webcomics
* Serial online fiction

When you click on the icon, it builds a list of bookmarks from the
same domain as current URL, sorts it by the common substring length,
and gives you a prompt to choose.
The new bookmark retains the folder and position of the old one.

Some special sorting methods may be added for specific domains in the
future.

Hotkey is Ctrl+Alt+D.
