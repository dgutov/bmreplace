This is a Mozilla Firefox extension that allows you to quickly replace an
existing bookmark with a bookmark of current page.

Can be useful for reading and tracking progress in series of articles,
webcomics, serial online fiction, etc.

When you click on the icon (or use the hotkey, Ctrl+Alt+D), it builds a list of
bookmarks from the same domain as the current URL, sorts them by similarity,
and gives you a prompt to choose.
The new bookmark retains the folder, position, and all tags of the old one.

If the old bookmark was tagged with `keep-title`, it keeps the old title.
The tag name is configurable, to change it, create a string preference in
about:config with the name `extensions.bmreplace.keep-title-tag`.
